# ðŸ“„ Meta-Indexer: Description Support in Uploads

This module supports adding human-readable **descriptions** (short or long) when uploading files. Descriptions are stored as part of the fileâ€™s metadata and help with later retrieval, documentation, and search.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Option 1: Add `--description` flag (inline)

Use this if your description is short and can be written directly in the terminal.

```bash
meta-indexer upload file.pdf --tags "domain=AI" --description "This paper explains the fundamentals of LLMs and transformers."
```

This uploads the file and stores a short description in the metadata.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Option 2: Pass description via a text file (for big descriptions)

Use this if your description is long or multi-line. Store it in a separate file and use `--description-file`.

```bash
meta-indexer upload file.pdf --tags "domain=AI" --description-file notes.txt
```

**Example: `notes.txt` content**
```txt
This is a comprehensive research paper explaining large language models (LLMs), their attention mechanisms, use in transformers, and their implications on natural language processing...
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Metadata Schema Update

A new top-level field `"description"` is added to your metadata schema as shown below:

```json
{
  "uuid": "unique_identifier_for_this_metadata_entry",
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  ...
  "description": "This paper explains the fundamentals of LLMs and transformers.",
  ...
}
```

For large descriptions:
```json
{
  ...
  "description": "This is a comprehensive research paper explaining large language models (LLMs), their attention mechanisms, use in transformers, and their implications on natural language processing...",
  ...
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Explain what the file is about
- Include author notes or context
- Help others understand the content without opening the file
- Improve search accuracy
