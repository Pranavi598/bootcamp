# 🏗 Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the web application’s architecture as illustrated in the included Draw.io diagram.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this architecture is to support a scalable, secure, and maintainable web application that handles user authentication, serves dynamic content, and integrates with external APIs.

## 🧱 Major Components

### 1. **Client (Frontend)**
- Built with React.js or similar SPA framework
- Responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions
- Communicates with backend via REST APIs

### 2. **API Gateway**
- Entry point for all client requests
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, and logging

### 3. **Authentication Service**
- Manages user login, signup, password reset
- Issues and verifies JWT tokens
- Can integrate with OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)

### 4. **Application Server**
- Hosts core business logic
- Connects to databases and external services
- Stateless and scalable

### 5. **Database**
- Stores persistent user data and app state
- Typically a relational DB like PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Includes indexing and backup strategies

### 6. **External API Integrations**
- Example: Email service, payment gateway
- Called via secure RESTful endpoints

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. User accesses the web app through the browser.
2. Client-side app sends API requests through the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway forwards authenticated requests to microservices.
4. Services process the request, read/write from the database, and return responses.
5. Responses are formatted and displayed by the frontend.

## ⚙️ Deployment Notes

- The system is designed to run on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Supports containerization with Docker and orchestration via Kubernetes
- Load balancers handle traffic distribution across app servers

---

## ✅ Key Constraints

- Stateless backend services
- Secure handling of credentials and user data
- API rate limiting and logging for observability
