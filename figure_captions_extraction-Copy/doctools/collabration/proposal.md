FEATURE PROPOSAL-Real-Time File Monitoring Dashboard

<h4>__Problem Statement__</h4>


In many developer and data engineering workflows, real-time monitoring of file changes in directories is critical for triggering automated processing pipelines. Currently, our bootcamp project requires manual execution of commands to process new files, which introduces delays and human error. There’s no user-friendly way to observe processing status, errors, or processor metrics in real time.

<h4>__Proposed Solution__</h4>


Implement a real-time file monitoring dashboard using __FastAPI__ that continuously watches a target folder and processes incoming files through our dataflow framework. The dashboard will expose system state, processor metrics, trace logs, and errors via a clean web interface, updating automatically as the system runs. This will significantly improve usability and visibility.

<h4>__Benefits__</h4>




* __Automation__: No need to manually trigger processing — just drop a file. \

* __Transparency__: Live view of what the system is doing at any moment. \

* __Debugging Help__: Instant feedback on processor errors or slowdowns. \

* __Professional Touch__: Demonstrates real-world applicability of FastAPI and streaming systems.
