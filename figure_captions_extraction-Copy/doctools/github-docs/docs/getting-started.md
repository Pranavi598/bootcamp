# Getting Started with GitHub Docs

Welcome to the GitHub Docs project! Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine and start contributing.

## 🛠️ Pre-Requisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Python 3.10+**: Required to run the MkDocs development server.

## 📥 Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/github-docs.git
cd github-docs
```

## ⚙️ Installing Dependencies

Once you have the project cloned, you can install the dependencies. If you don't have MkDocs installed, use the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

This will install MkDocs along with the Material theme.

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the MkDocs development server to see the documentation locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
