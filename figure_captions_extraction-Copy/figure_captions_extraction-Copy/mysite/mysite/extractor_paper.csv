1,PMC6821181,Figure and caption extraction from biomedical documents,"Figures and captions convey essential information in biomedical documents. As such, there is a growing interest in mining published biomedical figures and in utilizing their respective captions as a source of knowledge. Notably, an essential step underlying such mining is the extraction of figures and captions from publications. While several PDF parsing tools that extract information from such documents are publicly available, they attempt to identify images by analyzing the PDF encoding and structure and the complex graphical objects embedded within. As such, they often incorrectly identify figures and captions in scientific publications, whose structure is often non-trivial. The extraction of figures, captions and figure-caption pairs from biomedical publications is thus neither well-studied nor yet well-addressed."

3,PMC3041750,Cross-Cultural Patterns in Dynamic Ratings of Positive and Negative Natural Emotional Behaviour,"Studies of cross-cultural variations in the perception of emotion have typically compared rates of recognition of static posed stimulus photographs. That research has provided evidence for universality in the recognition of a range of emotions but also for some systematic cross-cultural variation in the interpretation of emotional expression. However, questions remain about how widely such findings can be generalised to real life emotional situations. The present study provides the first evidence that the previously reported interplay between universal and cultural influences extends to ratings of natural, dynamic emotional stimuli."
4,PMC3176818,Oncogenic Stress Induced by Acute Hyper-Activation of Bcr-Abl Leads to Cell Death upon Induction of Excessive Aerobic Glycolysis,"In response to deregulated oncogene activation, mammalian cells activate disposal programs such as programmed cell death. To investigate the mechanisms behind this oncogenic stress response we used Bcr-Abl over-expressing cells cultivated in presence of imatinib. Imatinib deprivation led to rapid induction of Bcr-Abl activity and over-stimulation of PI3K/Akt-, Ras/MAPK-, and JAK/STAT pathways. This resulted in a delayed necrosis-like cell death starting not before 48 hours after imatinib withdrawal. Cell death was preceded by enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and amino acid metabolism leading to elevated ATP and protein levels. This enhanced metabolism could be linked to induction of cell death as inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis was sufficient to sustain cell viability. Therefore, these data provide first evidence that metabolic changes induced by Bcr-Abl hyper-activation are important mediators of oncogenic stress-induced cell death."

7,PMC6007219,SPRENO: a BioC module for identifying organism terms in figure captions,"Recent advances in biological research reveal that the majority of the experiments strive for comprehensive exploration of the biological system rather than targeting specific biological entities. The qualitative and quantitative findings of the investigations are often exclusively available in the form of figures in published papers. There is no denying that such findings have been instrumental in intensive understanding of biological processes and pathways. However, data as such is unacknowledged by machines as the descriptions in the figure captions comprise of sumptuous information in an ambiguous manner. The abbreviated term âSINâ exemplifies such issue as it may stand for Sindbis virus or the sex-lethal interactor gene (Drosophila melanogaster). To overcome this ambiguity, entities should be identified by linking them to the respective entries in notable biological databases. Among all entity types, the task of identifying species plays a pivotal role in disambiguating related entities in the text. In this study, we present our species identification tool SPRENO (Species Recognition and Normalization), which is established for recognizing organism terms mentioned in figure captions and linking them to the NCBI taxonomy database by exploiting the contextual information from both the figure caption and the corresponding full text. To determine the ID of ambiguous organism mentions, two disambiguation methods have been developed. One is based on the majority rule to select the ID that has been successfully linked to previously mentioned organism terms. The other is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained by learning both the context and the distance information of the target organism mention. As a system based on the majority rule, SPRENO was one of the top-ranked systems in the BioCreative VI BioID track and achieved micro F-scores of 0.776 (entity recognition) and 0.755 (entity normalization) on the official test set, respectively. Additionally, the SPRENO-CNN exhibited better precisions with lower recalls and F-scores (0.720/0.711 for entity recognition/normalization). SPRENO is freely available at https://bigodatamining.github.io/software/201801/."
8,PMC7649569,Pathway information extracted from 25 years of pathway figures,"Thousands of pathway diagrams are published each year as static figures inaccessible to computational queries and analyses. Using a combination of machine learning, optical character recognition, and manual curation, we identified 64,643 pathway figures published between 1995 and 2019 and extracted 1,112,551 instances of human genes, comprising 13,464 unique NCBI genes, participating in a wide variety of biological processes. This collection represents an order of magnitude more genes than found in the text of the same papers, and thousands of genes missing from other pathway databases, thus presenting new opportunities for discovery and research."

Signs of cord infection are common in low-resource settings, yet the risk of mortality subsequent to these signs has not been quantified in either developed or developing countries. We compared the risk of mortality between infants with and without signs of umbilical cord infection during a community-based trial of chlorhexidine interventions in southern Nepal."
10,PMC10001065,Oligonucleotide Enhancing Compound Increases Tricyclo-DNA Mediated Exon-Skipping Efficacy in the Mdx Mouse Model,"Nucleic acid-based therapeutics hold great promise for the treatment of numerous diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Some antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drugs have already been approved by the US FDA for DMD, but the potential of this therapy is still limited by several challenges, including the poor distribution of ASOs to target tissues, but also the entrapment of ASO in the endosomal compartment. Endosomal escape is a well recognized limitation that prevents ASO from reaching their target pre-mRNA in the nucleus. Small molecules named oligonucleotide-enhancing compounds (OEC) have been shown to release ASO from endosomal entrapment, thus increasing ASO nuclear concentration and ultimately correcting more pre-mRNA targets. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a therapy combining ASO and OEC on dystrophin restoration in mdx mice. Analysis of exon-skipping levels at different time points after the co-treatment revealed improved efficacy, particularly at early time points, reaching up to 4.4-fold increase at 72 h post treatment in the heart compared to treatment with ASO alone. Significantly higher levels of dystrophin restoration were detected two weeks after the end of the combined therapy, reaching up to 2.7-fold increase in the heart compared to mice treated with ASO alone. Moreover, we demonstrated a normalization of cardiac function in mdx mice after a 12-week-long treatment with the combined ASO + OEC therapy. Altogether, these findings indicate that compounds facilitating endosomal escape can significantly improve the therapeutic potential of exon-skipping approaches offering promising perspectives for the treatment of DMD."
11,PMC6313431,The Implementation Process for Pharmacogenomic Testing for Cancer-Targeted Therapies,"Recent advances in genomic medicine have led to the availability of genomic tests that have the potential to improve population health, yet the process for obtaining these tests and getting them reimbursed by insurers has not been described. The objective of this study was to describe the process of ordering pharmacogenomic tests by interviewing providers, patients, and laboratories about cancer-related pharmacogenomic tests. We interviewed patients who were prescribed, providers who prescribed medications that should be guided by pharmacogenomic testing, and individuals from diagnostic laboratories. A total of 10 providers, 16 patients, and eight diagnostic laboratories described logistical and insurance issues relating to ordering and receiving pharmacogenomic tests and medications. We found that the process of ordering pharmacogenomic tests is time-consuming, expensive, and complex. Ordering pharmacogenomic tests is quite different across institutions. Even in the same institution, multiple providers can order the test. Once the provider places the order for the pharmacogenomic test, the laboratory receives the request and usually begins testing without knowing how the test will be paid for. Next, the laboratory completes the pharmacogenomic testing and the results of the tests are reported to providers, patients, or placed directly in the medical record. In conclusion, processes related to ordering and obtaining insurance coverage for pharmacogenomic tests varies greatly across institutions and is time-consuming."
