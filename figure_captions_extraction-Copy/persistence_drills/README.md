**Persistence using File and DB**

This project contains practice drills to learn Python object persistence and SQLite database operations.

**Python Persistence**

Serialize and deserialize Python objects using pickle.

Convert objects to/from JSON and YAML formats.

Handle complex objects, skip sensitive data, and manage object versioning.

Save and restore object states.

Handle cyclic references in serialization.

**SQLite Basics**

Install and test SQLite locally (sqlite3 example.db).

Create tables, insert, update, delete, and fetch data using SQLite CLI.

Understand transactions and ACID properties.

**Using SQLite with Python**

Connect to SQLite databases via Python sqlite3 module.

Implement CRUD operations through a Product class.

Use transactions for atomic operations.

Handle exceptions and data validation.

Perform joins, aggregation, batch inserts, and export data to CSV.

Simulate banking transfers and complex multi-table updates with transactions.

**How to Use**

Install dependencies (pip install pyyaml if needed).

Run scripts to perform persistence drills and database tasks.

Inspect SQLite .db files using CLI or DB Browser.
