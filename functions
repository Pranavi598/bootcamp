## üîç How to Use the `search_content` Function

### üö´ Without LLM

```bash
sudo findcontent / chromosome gene protein
```

We can search for the files using **GREP** and **strings** functions:

```bash
find /path/to/your/server/data/ -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' file; do
    # Use -f to read patterns from a file
    if grep -q -i -f keywords.txt "$file"; then
        echo "Found in (grep): $file"
    else
        # If grep doesn't find it, try strings + grep for binary/mixed files
        if strings "$file" | grep -q -i -f keywords.txt; then
            echo "Found in (strings + grep): $file"
        fi
    fi
done
```

We integrate the above functionality into the module itself.

So from the user‚Äôs terminal:

```bash
# If you suspect the keywords might be in user home directories:
sudo findcontent /home/ chromosome gene protein

# If you suspect they might be in an application's data directory:
sudo findcontent /opt/my_app/data/ chromosome gene protein
```
