# 🐍 Python Drills – Bootcamp

This repository contains structured Python drills designed to build deep fluency in modern Python development practices. Each section focuses on practical, production-ready programming through hands-on coding and exercises.

---

## 📘 Section 1: Core Python Proficiency

- Mastered data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Practiced comprehensions and generator expressions
- Wrote reusable functions and explored function arguments
- Understood variable scope, closures, and lexical environments
- Handled exceptions using try-except-else-finally
- Built custom iterators and generators

---

## 🧠 Section 2: Pythonic Idioms

- Applied EAFP vs. LBYL coding styles
- Used built-in functions (`any`, `all`, `zip`, `enumerate`, etc.)
- Practiced inline expressions (ternary, chaining, unpacking)
- Wrote context managers using `with` and custom `__enter__/__exit__`

---

## 🧱 Section 3: Object-Oriented Design

- Created classes and initialized objects
- Used inheritance, `super()`, and method overriding
- Explored dunder methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc.)
- Implemented `@dataclass` and `namedtuple` for cleaner models
- Understood static methods vs class methods

---

## ⚙️ Section 4: Functional Tools

- Treated functions as first-class citizens
- Created and applied decorators
- Used `functools` (`wraps`, `partial`, `lru_cache`)
- Leveraged `itertools` (`chain`, `groupby`, `islice`, etc.)

---

## 📦 Section 5: Standard Library Mastery

- Used `collections` (Counter, defaultdict, deque)
- Managed file paths with `os` and `pathlib`
- Worked with dates and times using `datetime`
- Handled serialization via `json`, `csv`, and `pickle`
- Ran subprocesses and explored concurrency basics

---

## ✅ Section 6: Data Validation & Code Clarity

- Built data models with `@dataclass` and manual validation
- Validated structured data using `pydantic`
- Improved readability with metadata and naming
- Configured structured logging for debugging and traceability
- Practiced clean code and naming conventions

---

## 🚀 Section 7: Performance & Debugging

- Profiled code using `time`, `cProfile`, and `line_profiler`
- Explored lazy evaluation techniques
- Used `pdb`, `breakpoint()`, and better exception handling
- Designed code with observability in mind (metrics, logs)
- Learned to package tools using `pyproject.toml`

---

## 🛠 Tools & Practices

- Python 3.10+
- VSCode / PyCharm for IDE
- Git for version control
- CLI tools and modular design

---

## 📌 Summary

This bootcamp series equipped us with the knowledge to write idiomatic, efficient, and production-grade Python code by deeply understanding the core language features and libraries.
