1. What are transactions?
A transaction is a set of database operations that are treated as a single unit.
Either all the changes happen, or none do.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Transferring money â€” withdraw from one account and deposit to another.

2. What are ACID Properties?
ACID stands for:

A â€“ Atomicity:
Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit â€” either all operations succeed or none are applied.

C â€“ Consistency:
Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, following all defined rules and constraints.

I â€“ Isolation:
Ensures that concurrent transactions do not affect each other, preventing race conditions or dirty reads.

D â€“ Durability:
Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanently saved, even in case of system crashes or power failures.

3. Suppose you do not have transactions. Is that system useful? Why?
It may work for simple or read-only use cases.
But for important systems like banking or inventory, it's risky and unreliable.
ðŸ‘‰ Data may become inconsistent, corrupt, or partially updated.

4. What properties does your file system have?
Most file systems offer:

Basic atomicity (e.g., full file write or nothing)

Durability once data is written to disk
But they lack full transactional support like databases.

5. Suppose you do not have "A" (Atomicity) in ACID â€” what happens? When is it ok?
What happens: Partial updates can occur (e.g., money withdrawn but not deposited).

When it's OK: For non-critical operations, like logging or analytics.

6. Suppose you do not have "C" (Consistency)?
What happens: Invalid data can enter the system (e.g., negative balance).

When it's OK: In temporary states like caching, where final consistency is restored later.

7. Suppose you do not have "I" (Isolation)?
What happens: Transactions can interfere (e.g., two users buy the last item).

When it's OK: High-speed apps like social media likes â€” exact count isn't critical.

8. Suppose you do not have "D" (Durability)?
What happens: Committed changes may disappear after a crash.

When it's OK: In-memory systems where data can be rebuilt (e.g., session data in Redis).
